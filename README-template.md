## Overview


### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

### Screenshot

==== Screenshot are inside the file path.

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

## My process

Critical thinking with
HTML
CSS
Flexbox

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned the use of the HTML element and CSS property can work together.

```html
<div class="hover-option"></div>
```

Learned new CSS property that can add interactive on the webpage.
```css
.image-container:hover .hover-option + .view{
    display: block;
    visibility: visible;
    height: 50px;
    width: 50px;
}
```
